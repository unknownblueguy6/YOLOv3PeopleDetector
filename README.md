# YOLOv3 People Detector

Uses YOLOv3 to detect people in images, or through a webcam.

## How to use
Run [yolo_webcam.py](https://github.com/unknownblueguy6/YOLOv3PeopleDetector/blob/master/yolo_webcam.py)  to detect people through the webcam.

To detect people in a set of images, place them in the input folder and run [yolo.py](https://github.com/unknownblueguy6/YOLOv3PeopleDetector/blob/master/yolo.py)
I've added a few test images in the input and output folders.
